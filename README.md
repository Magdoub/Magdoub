**Software is eating the world and I'm quite hungry.**

Product Manager who translates technology into happiness. 15 years building SaaS products — from consumer web apps visited by millions to enterprise tools.

Currently running Product at **Luciq** (mobile dev tools). Previously led product at **Forasna** & **Wuzzuf**. Co-founded **Soutak**.

I help product teams answer three questions:
- What people problem are we trying to solve?
- How do we know this is a real problem?
- How will we know if we've solved this problem?

I thrive in uncertainty and maker cultures where prototyping and experimenting are the norm.
