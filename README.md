**Software is eating the world and I'm quite hungry.**

Engineer, turned Designer, turned PM.

I help product teams answer three questions:
- What people problem are we trying to solve?
- How do we know this is a real problem?
- How will we know if we've solved this problem?

I thrive in uncertainty and maker cultures where prototyping and experimenting are the norm.
